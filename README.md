# IPL_Prediction

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast the outcomes of IPL matches based on historical match data. This model aims to provide insights and predictions for cricket enthusiasts and analysts, enhancing their understanding and enjoyment of the game.

The project involves analyzing the IPL match dataset obtained from Kaggle using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis will utilize libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, and the model will be saved using the pickle library. Streamlit will be used to create an interactive web application that allows users to input match details and receive predictions.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can forecast the outcomes of IPL matches based on historical match data. The project involves analyzing the IPL dataset, building a machine learning model, and deploying an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language for data manipulation, analysis, and model development.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Scikit-Learn**: To build and evaluate the machine learning model.
- **Streamlit**: To create an interactive web application for user input and prediction visualization.
- **Pickle**: For model serialization and saving.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and experimentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjidoolla/ipl-data-set), containing historical data of IPL matches. The dataset includes details such as teams, scores, wickets, overs, and match outcomes, which are crucial for training the predictive model.
